# Framing

---

## Main context

An introductory data science course that 

- provides a common (gateway) experience to students wanting to get started with stats
- is modern
- places data front and center
- is quantitative (but without math prereqs)
- is different than HS statistics
- is challenging, but not intimidating

---

## Other uses for the computational infrastructure

- An applied statistics course
- A statistical computing course
- A case studies course
- A project-based capstone course
- ...
